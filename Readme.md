### Roadmap:
- load more sample data

- create the search by Job posts part. Currently - we can use tags only to refine searches
- create top rated part
- add option for the user to like specific jobPosts
- add commenting option for user on every posting
- add pagination


## initial plan is to have an application, using the following:
- expressJs
- mongoDb via mongooseJs
- db stored in mlab
- ssr, using pug/jade
- authenticates w passport via local strategy. stores hashed session data(non stateless)
